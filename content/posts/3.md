# React Hooks – A Guide to useEffect

When React introduced **Hooks**, one of the most transformative ones was `useEffect`. This hook allows functional components to perform **side effects**, such as fetching data, interacting with the DOM, or cleaning up resources. Let’s dive into how `useEffect` works and its common use cases.

## What is useEffect?
`useEffect` is a hook that lets you perform side effects in function components. Side effects include tasks like:
- Fetching data from an API
- Subscribing to a WebSocket
- Manipulating the DOM directly

It replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class-based components.

### Basic Example
```js
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component mounted');

    // Cleanup function to handle unmounting
    return () => {
      console.log('Component unmounted');
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures it runs only on mount

  return <div>Example Component</div>;
}
