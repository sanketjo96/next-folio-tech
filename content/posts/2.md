# JavaScript Destructuring – The Key to Cleaner Code

In modern JavaScript development, **destructuring** has become one of the most efficient ways to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects. It simplifies your code and makes it more readable. Let’s explore how it works and why you should be using it.

## Array Destructuring
Array destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays in a clean and concise manner. For example:

```js
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
const [first, second, third] = fruits;
console.log(first);  // 'apple'
console.log(second); // 'banana'
console.log(third);  // 'cherry'
